# Summary

| Date  | Notes
| :---- | :----
| 07/10 | Continued to bugfix REINFORCE algorithm
| 07/11 | Had wisdom tooth surgery at 8 am today, frankly didn't get much of anything done
| 07/12 | Got REINFORCE into a state I was happy with (still very slow however)
| 07/13 | Played around with minimalRL library, began making sokoban work with much faster base code
| 07/14 | Finished making sokoban work with faster base code, began to explore a2c

# Activities

In general, worked on implementing REINFORCE algorithm in both my original code and the minimalRL environment. I also began to explore how the actor-critic algorithm worked.

# Issues

Didn't really run into any issues with the code but obviously my surgery took me out for a bit of the week

# Plans

Explore the new algorithm, in tandem with developing the algorithm I had found in the paper last week.

# Article Summaries

Didn't really read any articles this week.
