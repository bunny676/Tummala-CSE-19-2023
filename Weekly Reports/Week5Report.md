| 07/26 | Continued to work on a2c (mostly trying to get multiprocessing working)
| 07/27 | Finished a2c and began to test
| 07/28 | Began to explore new neural network configurations

# Activities

I spent the bulk of the week modifying the a2c model provided by minimalRL to work with my environment, but after some testing I realized it wasn't performing that great. I decided to start to try different neural network configurations besides only Dense layers.

# Issues

I didn't run into any major issues, but my reinforcement learning still isn't performing ideally due to my network being not as complex as I would like it to be.

# Plans

Explore making the network stronger and then implement forward-backward reinforce.

Generation of Sokoban Stages using Recurrent Neural Networks
- Used an LSTM network to solve Sokoban problems with a 99% success rate (will try to use a CNN+LSTM model in my code)
