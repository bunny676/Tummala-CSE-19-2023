# Activities

The week was basically spent trying to get ConvLSTM to work, with finding parameters to use and modifying the minimalRL code to work with it.

# Issues

The ConvLSTM is taking much longer than I anticipated to work with gym, but I think I'm on the home stretch and can hopefully finish it ASAP.

# Plans

Finish ConvLSTM and dive straight into forward-backward reinforce.
