# Plans

My main plain for the upcoming week is to (this is too much for one person):

- work on the simulation,
- work on the circuit diagrams for the physical robot,
- work on the CAD design of the chassis,
- start setting up the deep learning pipeline, and
- start working with the Nano and cameras.

# Article Summaries

None this week. So I should just remove this section.
