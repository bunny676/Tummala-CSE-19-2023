| 08/10 | Started trying to get the forward-backward reinforce algorithm working
| 08/11 | Continued working on the forward-backward reinforce

# Activities

Spent the week getting ConvLSTM to work and then moved on to the forward-backward reinforce algorithm.

# Issues

The ConvLSTM runs incredibly slowly on my laptop with 3 cores (left it on overnight, ~20 iterations around a score of 25). On Google Colab, it does not have access to multiple cores, so it runs at around the same speed.

# Plans

See how well forward-backward reinforce performs and then work on final presentation.
